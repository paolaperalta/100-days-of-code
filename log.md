# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 14th, 2020 
##### Figuring out a roadmap

**Today's Progress**: Decided to work on front end challenges (Front Loops) and the Responsive Web Design certification in freeCodeCamp. Finished a Flexbox training I had been working on (Flexbox Zombies)
 
**Thoughts**: My ultimate goal is to work in UX design, and this seems like a good place to start.

### Day 2: July 15th, 2020 
##### Diving back in

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the initial HTML and CSS challenges in freeCodeCamp. Completed HTML and got to 25% of the CSS one. Session lasted for around 90 mins.

**Thoughts**: I've wanted to do a basic HTML training since I first started to learn code a couple of years ago. I skipped the basic lessons for this course because I joined once they had already been dictated, so this is a nice way to jump back in. This will also give me the tools I need to start working on the Front Loops challenges.

### Day 3: July 16th, 2020 
##### CSS basics & Applied Visual Design

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Basic CSS module in freeCodeCamp and the Applied Visual Design one. 

**Thoughts**: I am finding that the best time for me to work on this is early in the morning. I am not always able to do that but today was a good day in terms of motivation and I put in more than 3 hours. Excited to be learning about CSS animations!

### Day 4: July 17th, 2020 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed Applied Accessibility and Responsive Web Design Pricinciples.  

**Thoughts**: I struggled more to concentrate today but got through both modules anyway.

### Day 5: July 19th, 2020 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Flexbox certification.

**Thoughts**: So yesterday was Saturday and I skipped it. I find that I need to detox from the screens at some point in the week because being in quarantine is not helping with my screen addiction. By Friday I needed someone to just rip the phone from my hand already. I am adding a day at the end of the challenge and I didn't skip today so I'm good. As for the training, the flexbox section of the certification was easy enough since I completed the flexbox zombies game two times now, but I kept thinking that if this was my first approach to flexbox ever I would be super confused as this was just an over-simpilified version of the concepts. I hope the rest of the course is not that too, but I guess that I won't really know until I start putting a real project together. I am thinking I'll complete the Laravel training I bought last year next and then try to do something functional, most probably an e-commerce site. But that's just one way to go and something I am somewhat more familiar with since that was my first approach to coding last year.

### Day 6: July 20th, 2020 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Tried to apply some of what I've seen to the first Front Loops challenge. I realized I sitll would need a lot more basic concepts to just be able to do this without any kind of guidance. I completed it but not entirely from scratch and I used a lot of the code in the solution, though I paid attention to what it does and how things change if I tweak it. Still, I have a long way to go and I'm thinking I should work on some other kind of training before I keep going with freeCodeCamp because the concepts I'm going through there are not really sticking. I remember in the course we did last year we covered how to use mediaqueries and I might try to do this same challenge again using them and flexbox, though the solution they provided seems simpler so it might not be necessary. Still don't know why the first card's hover has less height than the other two. 

**Thoughts**: Working on an actual project at this point was good because I can see all the areas where I still need help. I still have a long ways to go! The link to the work below is pretty neat but I didn't do it from scratch or without any help, really. But still, this was helpful as a way to jump back in. Also, I am still investigating how to set this up in Github so that the work is viewable, so I'll just include the address of the file below for now.
