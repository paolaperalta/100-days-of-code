# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 14th, 2020 
##### Figuring out a roadmap

**Today's Progress**: Decided to work on front end challenges (Front Loops) and the Responsive Web Design certification in freeCodeCamp. Finished a Flexbox training I had been working on (Flexbox Zombies)
 
**Thoughts**: My ultimate goal is to work in UX design, and this seems like a good place to start.

### Day 2: July 15th, 2020 
##### Diving back in

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the initial HTML and CSS challenges in freeCodeCamp. Completed HTML and got to 25% of the CSS one. Session lasted for around 90 mins.

**Thoughts**: I've wanted to do a basic HTML training since I first started to learn code a couple of years ago. I skipped the basic lessons for this course because I joined once they had already been dictated, so this is a nice way to jump back in. This will also give me the tools I need to start working on the Front Loops challenges.

### Day 3: July 16th, 2020 
##### CSS basics & Applied Visual Design

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Basic CSS module in freeCodeCamp and the Applied Visual Design one. 

**Thoughts**: I am finding that the best time for me to work on this is early in the morning. I am not always able to do that but today was a good day in terms of motivation and I put in more than 3 hours. Excited to be learning about CSS animations!

##### 

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed Applied Accessibility and Responsive Web Design Pricinciples.  

**Thoughts**: I struggled more to concentrate today but got through both modules anyway.

### Day 5: July 19th, 2020 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Flexbox certification.

**Thoughts**: So yesterday was Saturday and I skipped it. I find that I need to detox from the screens at some point in the week because being in quarantine is not helping with my screen addiction. By Friday I needed someone to just rip the phone from my hand already. I am adding a day at the end of the challenge and I didn't skip today so I'm good. As for the training, the flexbox section of the certification was easy enough since I completed the flexbox zombies game two times now, but I kept thinking that if this was my first approach to flexbox ever I would be super confused as this was just an over-simpilified version of the concepts. I hope the rest of the course is not that too, but I guess that I won't really know until I start putting a real project together. I am thinking I'll complete the Laravel training I bought last year next and then try to do something functional, most probably an e-commerce site. But that's just one way to go and something I am somewhat more familiar with since that was my first approach to coding last year.
