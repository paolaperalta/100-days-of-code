# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 14th, 2020 
##### Figuring out a roadmap

**Today's Progress**: Decided to work on front end challenges (Front Loops) and the Responsive Web Design certification in FreeCodeCamp. Finished a Flexbox training I had been working on (Flexbox Zombies)
 
**Thoughts**: My ultimate goal is to work on UX design, so Front End seems like a good place to start.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
