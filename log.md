# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 14th, 2020 
##### Figuring out a roadmap

**Today's Progress**: Decided to work on front end challenges (Front Loops) and the Responsive Web Design certification in freeCodeCamp. Finished a Flexbox training I had been working on (Flexbox Zombies)
 
**Thoughts**: My ultimate goal is to work in UX design, and this seems like a good place to start.

### Day 2: July 15th, 2020 
##### Diving back in

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the initial HTML and CSS challenges in freeCodeCamp. Completed HTML and got to 25% of the CSS one. Session lasted for around 90 mins.

**Thoughts**: I've wanted to do a basic HTML training since I first started to learn code a couple of years ago. I skipped the basic lessons for this course because I joined once they had already been dictated, so this is a nice way to jump back in. This will also give me the tools I need to start working on the Front Loops challenges.

### Day 3: July 16th, 2020 
##### CSS basics & Applied Visual Design

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Basic CSS module in freeCodeCamp and the Applied Visual Design one. 

**Thoughts**: I am finding that the best time for me to work on this is early in the morning. I am not always able to do that but today was a good day in terms of motivation and I put in around X hours. Excited to be learning about CSS animations!
